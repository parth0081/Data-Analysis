#### Data analysis is the process of gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and mining data, interpreting results and reporting the findings. With data analysis, we find patterns within data and correlations between different data points. And it is through these patterns and correlations that insights are generated, and conclusions are drawn.

* Having gathered the data, the next step is to clean the data, fix quality issues in the data that could affect the accuracy of the analysis. * 

* Once the data is clean, you will extract and analyze the data from different perspectives. *

* After analyzing your data and possibly conducting further research, which can be an iterative loop, itâ€™s time to interpret your results. *

### Ultimately, the goal of any analysis is to impact decision making. The ability to communicate and present your findings in clear and impactful ways is as important a part of the data analysis process as is the analysis itself.
